# How to upload and view Python-selenium terminal logs on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Python-selenium-upload-file) 

If you want to upload and view Python-selenium terminal logs on LambdaTest, you can follow the below steps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample).

# Steps:

You can upload any test/terminal report generated by the testing framework in json,xml,txt and other common format. The file uploaded can then be viewed in the automation dashboard page under LOGS sections. The file size should not exceed 2MB.

The terminal logs can be uploaded using the LambdaTest API.

### Step 1: Authorise using credentials

Go to the LambdaTest API webpage [here](https://automation-api-docs.lambdatest.com/index.html).
Use the **Authorise** button to fill your valid LambdaTest credentials to authenticate your API requests.

### Step 2: 

Go to the session section and select the terminal logs POST request [(link)](https://automation-api-docs.lambdatest.com/index.html#/Session/UploadTerminalLogs). Provide your session-id and select the log file you want to upload (json,xml, txt) . 

Note: You can also do this with a CURL command like so (replace session-d, auth code and filename):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lambdatest.com/automation/api/v1/sessions/session-id/terminal-logs" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Basic aWliMjAxOTAyNDprUlZIV2lQRHlUR0JkZU9qbpadUGN2WUZHSVBhalNYc3hRN0ZDeWpqbDZxNUlzRWo1aA==" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=filename"
```

After a successful POST request, you should be able to view terminal logs for the session on your dashboard.
